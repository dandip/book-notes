I do a lot of technical reading (mostly statistics, probability, machine learning, and finance).
Whenever I read a text, I summarize and explain its content as I go along,
somewhat in the style of university lecture notes.  For me, this process is superb for retaining what you read
and distilling complicated technical texts to their core. They're not *that* short, but they're at least
10x shorter than the book itself. Historically, these notes have served as useful reference
material for me and my friends.

Rather than having these notes saved privately, I decided to make this website. Selfishly, I'm hoping that
it'll keep them better organized, accessible, and shareable. Unselfishly, I'm happy if people find my notes
useful (selfish addendum: maybe it's an ego boost?).
