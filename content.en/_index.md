# What is this website?

I do a lot of technical reading (mostly statistics, probability, machine learning, and finance).
Whenever I read a text, I summarize and explain its content as I go along,
somewhat in the style of university lecture notes. They're not *that* short, but they're at least
10x shorter than the book itself. Historically, these notes have served as useful reference
material for me and my friends. This process of learning is also superb for retaining what you read
and distilling complicated technical texts to their core.

Rather than having these notes saved privately, I decided to make this website. Selfishly, I'm hoping that
it'll keep them better organized, accessible, and shareable. Unselfishly, I'm happy if people find my notes
useful (selfish addendum: maybe it's an ego boost?).
